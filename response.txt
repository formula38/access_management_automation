# Strategic Vision for Automated Data Access Management

## **Problem Understanding**

- **Challenges:**
  - Manual, inconsistent, and ad-hoc data access processes.
  - Delays in granting and revoking access.
  - Difficulty in auditing and ensuring compliance.
  - Need to manage access for both Looker Studio dashboards and Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL/MSSQL).
- **Goals:**
  - Automate and standardize access requests, approvals, and provisioning.
  - Enforce security policies (least privilege, approval workflows).
  - Maintain a clear, auditable trail of all access grants and removals.
  - Ensure scalability, maintainability, and data sovereignty.

## **Key Stakeholders & Roles**

- **Data Consumer:** Requests access via self-service portal.
- **Data Owner/Manager:** Approves or denies requests.
- **Security/Governance Team:** Defines policies, monitors compliance.
- **Automation System:** Executes provisioning, de-provisioning, and logging.

    C --> D[Policy Check (ChromaDB)]
    D --> E[Approval Workflow]
    E --> F[Automated Provisioning (Python/GCP SDK)]
    F --> G[Audit Logging (Postgres/ChromaDB)]
    F --> H[De-provisioning Scheduler (n8n)]
    G --> I[Monitoring & Alerts (Prometheus/Grafana)]
```

### **Workflow Steps**

1. **User Initiation:**  
   - User submits an access request via Angular UI.
   - Smart form uses Ollama RAG to suggest access levels and validate against policies in real time.

2. **Approval Workflow:**  
   - n8n orchestrates multi-level approval, routing based on data sensitivity and user context.
   - Ollama LLM provides risk assessment and compliance recommendations.

3. **Automated Provisioning:**  
   - Upon approval, n8n triggers Python scripts to:
     - Grant access to Looker Studio dashboards via API.
     - Create roles and grant user permissions in Cloud SQL using Google Cloud SDK.
   - All actions are logged for auditability.

4. **Audit Logging:**  
   - Every action (request, approval, provisioning, de-provisioning) is logged in Postgres and ChromaDB.
   - Ollama analyzes logs for anomalies and compliance.

5. **Automated De-provisioning:**  
   - n8n scheduled jobs revoke expired access and trigger reviews.

## **Technical Components & Technologies**

- **n8n:** Visual workflow engine for orchestration, approvals, and scheduling.
- **Ollama (LLM):** Local RAG system for policy interpretation, risk analysis, and recommendations.
- **ChromaDB:** Vector database for semantic policy search and RAG.
- **Angular:** Modern UI for access requests and admin workflows.
- **Python (FastAPI):** Backend API, provisioning logic, and audit logging.
- **Google Cloud SDK:** Cloud SQL and Looker Studio integration.
- **PostgreSQL:** Centralized storage for users, requests, policies, and audit logs.
- **Prometheus/Grafana:** Monitoring, metrics, and alerting.

## **Sample Automated Provisioning Code (Python)**

```python
from google.cloud import sql_v1beta4
import psycopg2

def grant_postgres_access(instance_id, db_user, db_name, role, project_id, db_host, db_port, db_admin_user, db_admin_password):
    # Step 1: Create user in Cloud SQL via Google Cloud SDK
    client = sql_v1beta4.SqlUsersServiceClient()
    user = {"name": db_user, "host": "%", "password": "secure-temp-password"}
    client.insert(project=project_id, instance=instance_id, body=user)

    # Step 2: Grant role/permissions using direct DB connection
    conn = psycopg2.connect(
        host=db_host,
        port=db_port,
        dbname=db_name,
        user=db_admin_user,
        password=db_admin_password
    )
    conn.autocommit = True
    with conn.cursor() as cur:
        cur.execute(f"GRANT {role} TO {db_user};")
    conn.close()

    # Step 3: Log the provisioning action (to audit log, not shown here)
    print(f"Granted {role} to {db_user} on {db_name} and logged the action.")

# Example usage
grant_postgres_access(
    instance_id="my-sql-instance",
    db_user="alice",
    db_name="sales_db",
    role="read_only",
    project_id="my-gcp-project",
    db_host="127.0.0.1",
    db_port=5432,
    db_admin_user="postgres",
    db_admin_password="supersecret"
)
```

## **Sample Access Policy (JSON)**

```json
{
    "resource": "multi-service:sales-data",
    "services": {
      "cloudsql": {
        "instance": "sales-db-instance",
        "database": "sales_db",
        "gcp_iam_bindings": [
          {
            "role": "roles/cloudsql.client",
            "members": ["user:alice@company.com"]
          }
        ]
      },
      "looker_studio": {
        "dashboard_id": "sales-dashboard-123",
        "gcp_iam_bindings": [
          {
            "role": "roles/datastudio.user",
            "members": ["user:alice@company.com"]
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    "unified_workflow": {
      "approval_required": true,
      "approvers": ["data-owner@company.com"],
      "access_duration": "30d",
      "audit": {
        "enabled": true,
        "log_level": "detailed"
      }
    }

  - **Provisioning Time:** Reduced from hours/days to minutes.
  - **Audit Completeness:** 100% of actions logged and traceable.
  - **Policy Compliance:** All access grants validated against policies.
  - **De-provisioning Rate:** Expired access automatically removed.
